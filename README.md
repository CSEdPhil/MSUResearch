This is a automation experiment using the proxy service of the MSU library.

To install, download everything to a folder on your computer. Then navigate to chrome://extensions using Googla Chrome. Turn on "Developer Mode". Select "Load Unpacked" and upload all files to the extensions website. Then you can activate the extension and try it in your Chrome browser.

To use the extension, go to Google Scholar and search for something of interest to you. You can click the button on your browser to translate all of the links so that they will open directly to the link using the library proxy (assuming you are logged in to MSU's proxy service). If you are on a journal page that you would like to use the library proxy, you can click the button there to translate the link.

Author note: I do not endorse Google Chrome, which is a crappy piece of software. You should use a derivative of Chromium if anything in that ecosystem.
