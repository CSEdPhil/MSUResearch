This is a automation experiment using the proxy service of the MSU library.

To install, download everything to a folder on your computer. Then navigate to chrome://extensions using Googla Chrome. Turn on "Developer Mode". Select "Load Unpacked" and upload all files to the extensions website. Then you can activate the extension and try it in your Chrome browser.

Author note: I do not endorse Google Chrome, which is a crappy piece of software. You should use a derivative of Chromium if anything in that ecosystem.
